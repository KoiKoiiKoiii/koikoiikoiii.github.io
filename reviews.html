      <h2>Welcome to My Game Reviews</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! This is my little corner of the internet where I dive deep into the games that have captured my
        attention. Whether it's a story-driven indie gem, a chaotic multiplayer shooter, or a nostalgic classic from my
        backlog, you'll find my personal takes, honest ratings, and maybe even a few spicy opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't just score games. I talk about how they feel, what they get right (or horribly wrong), and what moments
        stuck with me long after the credits rolled. If you're looking for thoughtful reviews with a bit of personality,
        you're in the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scroll down, find your next favorite game, and don't be shy - I love chatting about games, so feel free to reach
        out on social media too. Reviews update as I play more, so check back often!

      <img src="./IMG/Game Review Covers/FFXIV.png" alt="Final Fantasy XIV cover" class="game-cover">

      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>

      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC, Steam, Xbox, PS5</p>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy, MMORPG, Open World</p>
      <p><strong>Time Played:</strong> ~5,000 hours; Ongoing</p>

      <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong>
        Final Fantasy XIV is a massive, open-world MMORPG that offers a deep and engaging experience. The story is
        complex and well-written, with a focus on character development and world-building. The gameplay is balanced and
        offers something for everyone, from casual players to hardcore enthusiasts.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Loved:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deep and engaging story</li>
        <li>Beautiful art style</li>
        <li>Dynamic and evolving gameplay</li>
        <li>Strong community and player support</li>
        <li>Great character customization</li>
        <li>Excellent end-game content</li>
        <li>Constant updates and improvements</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What Could Be Better:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some areas can feel repetitive</li>
        <li>The report system can be overwhelming</li>
        <li>Character design can be hit or miss</li>
        <li>Some characters can't wear certain armor</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Would I Recommend It?</strong>
        Yes, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep progression systems and a rich story. The story is entirely
        optional, so you can focus on the gameplay if you prefer. This is a great 'First MMO' for those who want to try
        the genre.

      <img src="./IMG/Game Review Covers/ESO.png" alt="Elder Scrolls Online cover" class="game-cover">

      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>

      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC, Steam, Xbox, PS5</p>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy, MMORPG, Open World</p>
      <p><strong>Time Played:</strong> ~2,500 hours; Completed</p>

      <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong>
        Elder Scrolls Online is a massive, open-world MMORPG that offers a deep and engaging experience. The story is
        complex and well-written, with a focus on character development and world-building. The gameplay is balanced and
        offers something for everyone, from casual players to hardcore enthusiasts.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Loved:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Entire story is voiced, and the voice acting is very good</li>
        <li>Rich lore and world-building from the Elder Scrolls universe</li>
        <li>Flexible class system allowing for diverse character builds</li>
        <li>Beautiful and diverse landscapes across Tamriel, allowing you to visit places you couldn't in previous games
        </li>
        <li>Extensive housing system with great customization options</li>
        <li>Regular content updates and expansions</li>
        <li>Active and helpful community</li>
        <li>Great crafting system with meaningful progression</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What Could Be Better:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The story is not for everyone, and can be very slow-paced</li>
        <li>The game can be very grindy at times, and the crafting system can be very confusing</li>
        <li>The game can be very expensive to play, with many microtransactions</li>
        <li>Lack of real depth to the combat, and the combat can get very repetitive</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Would I Recommend It?</strong>
        No, I would not recommend it to anyone. The changes that have been made to the game have ruined the experience
        for me. I'm not sure if I'll ever return to the game. Maybe if they made all the microtransactions earnable in
        the base game, I would consider it.

      <p><strong>Time Played:</strong> 142.6 hours; Completed</p>

      <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong>
        Persona 5 Royal is a turn-based RPG with one of the greatest stories I've ever seen in a video game. The combat
        takes some getting used to if you're not used to turn-based combat, but it's a lot of fun once you get the hang
        of it.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Loved:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amazing story</li>
        <li>Great character development</li>

        <li>The combat can get very repetitive if you're not a fan of turn-based combat</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Would I Recommend It?</strong>
        Absolutely. This is a must-play for anyone who wants a story-driven RPG with a great story, characters, and
        combat. I've played and watched others play this game multiple times, and I still love it.

      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> FPS, Multiplayer</p>
      <p><strong>Time Played:</strong> ~500 hours; Completed</p>

      <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong>
        Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a first-person shooter with a focus on multiplayer. The campaign is short and not
        very good, but the multiplayer is fun and has a lot of depth.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Loved:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Great multiplayer</li>
        <li>Great soundtrack</li>
        <li>Great graphics</li>

      <ul>
        <li>The developer care is lacking, and the game has a lot of bugs</li>
        <li>The campaign is short and not very good</li>
        <li>The game is very expensive to play</li>

        <li>The game is very repetitive</li>
        <li>The game is very unbalanced</li>

      <p><strong>Would I Recommend It?</strong>
        If you're a fan of the Call of Duty series, I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would not recommend it. This one
        is the same as every other Call of Duty game but slightly more fast-paced than previous titles.

      <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong>
        Skyrim is a first-person RPG with a focus on exploration and combat. The campaign is long and has a lot of
        depth,
        but the combat can get very repetitive.
      </p>

        <li>The puzzles are not very good</li>
        <li>Lack of an engaging main story</li>
        <li>More variety in the world would be nice</li>
        <li>4 different copies of the same game</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Would I Recommend It?</strong>
        Skyrim is a great game, and a great first RPG. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a story-driven RPG with
        a
        great open world and lots of content to do. I would recommend playing the Special Edition, as it is the best
        version of the game.

      <p><strong>Time Played:</strong> 10 hours; Completed</p>

      <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong>
        In this horror adventure game, play as 11-year-old girl Aya Drevis and uncover the secrets of a bizarre incident
        that befalls the Drevis residence, where maniacal experiments are conducted night after night.

      <p><strong>What Could Be Better:</strong></p>

        <li>The game is very easy to get stuck on</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Would I Recommend It?</strong>
        Absolutely. I can't think of another horror game that has made me feel as uncomfortable as this one in a 2D
        landscape. They have a great remake on Steam, so I would recommend playing that instead of the original.

      <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong>
        Halo: The Master Chief Collection is a collection of all the best Halo games, with a focus on multiplayer. The
        campaign is amazing, and the multiplayer is fun and has a lot of depth. Definitely worth the price.

        experience the series and a great way to sink your teeth into a great storyline.

      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/10</p>

      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> Steam</p>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> FPS, Multiplayer</p>
      <p><strong>Time Played:</strong> ~700 hours; Ongoing</p>

      <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong>
        Overwatch 2 is a first-person shooter with a focus on multiplayer. There is no campaign. The multiplayer is the
        only source of content, and it can run stale very quickly.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Loved:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The graphics are stylized and fit the world of Overwatch</li>
        <li>The gameplay is fun and has a lot of depth</li>
        <li>The characters are great</li>
        <li>The maps are fun and have a lot of variety</li>
        <li>The game is very addictive once you're into it</li>
        <li>Good progression system</li>
        <li>Better with friends</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What Could Be Better:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The developers are very bad at balancing the game</li>
        <li>The game can run stale very quickly</li>
        <li>The game is very grindy</li>
        <li>Too many microtransactions</li>
        <li>Hard to navigate the hero pool if you're not used to it</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Would I Recommend It?</strong>
        As many problems as Overwatch 2 has, I would still recommend it. It's a great game if you ignore the criticisms
        and just enjoy the team-based gameplay. I couldn't think of another game that can do it exactly the way that
        Overwatch 2 has. Team Fortress 2 is similar, but not quite the same.

        Assassin's Creed 1 is a great game that is a great way to experience the world of the Assassin's Creed series.
