        <h2>Mindie,</h2>
        <p class="love-letter">
            As I sit here thinking about our first year together, my heart is overflowing with love and gratitude for you. It feels like just yesterday when our paths crossed, and now, after 365 days (and then some), I can’t imagine my life without you by my side. <br><br> The way you smile when you’re happy, the way you laugh when something excites you, the way your eyes light up whenever we talk about our plans for the future. Everything about you, big and small, has made this year the most beautiful chapter of my life. You’ve filled my world with so much joy and warmth and I could never find the words to explain just how thankful I am for you and all the love you’ve given me.<br><br>

In just one year, we’ve created a lifetime of memories - something I can’t say I’ve ever done with anyone else or would ever want to do with anyone else. You truly do make living life special. From our quiet, cozy evenings on Final Fantasy or other games, or the adventures we’ve had meeting up (like remember those cool penguins we went to go see? Your eyes were so beautiful in that lighting) - every second with you has felt like a blessing and still continues to feel like a blessing. I can’t wait to continue writing our story, one chapter at a time, hand in hand, through whatever life throws at us.<br><br>

You’ve shown me what true love is - not in grand gestures, but in the little things we do for each other every day. Your kindness, patience, and unwavering support has taught me more about love than I could ever even begin to know. You’ve made me want to be the best version of myself, and I promise to keep growing alongside you.<br><br>

On this special day, I want to remind you how much I love you - how <em>deeply</em> I cherish you - and how grateful I am that we found each other. Had it not been for FFXIV, Foxy, and all the events that had unraveled to bring us together, our blossoming love would’ve never seen the light of day. Crazy to think that just a few things were enough to stop us from inevitably meeting, but god am I glad that everything has went the way it has.<br><br>

Mindie, you are not just my partner - you’re my best friend. My greatest joy. Every single day we’ve been together has felt like a dream I never want to wake up from.<br><br>

Here’s to us, to our love, and to many more years of happiness together. I love you more than words can ever express.
<br><br>
