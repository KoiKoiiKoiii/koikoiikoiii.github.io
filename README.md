# _What is this?_

This is my personal website where I showcase my projects, skills, and interests. It's a central hub for all my work — featuring my portfolio, blog posts, and insights into the things I'm passionate about. I’ve designed it to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate, reflecting my style and values.

Features
- About Me: A brief introduction and my background.
- Contact: Ways to reach out to me, including social links and a contact form.
- Game Reviews: A list of games that I've enjoyed recently, as well as a full filter option.
- Responsive Design: Works beautifully across all devices, from desktops to mobile.
Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, this website is designed to evolve alongside my journey.

Feel free to explore and connect with me!
